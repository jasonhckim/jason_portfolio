# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/jasonhckim/Linear_Regression_Project)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**93%** accuracy](https://github.com/jasonhckim/Linear_Regression_Project/blob/main/Linear_Regression_Project.ipynb).

- Used Random Forest Regressor to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Random Forest Regressor with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Prediction of User Interest Using Bank Data](https://github.com/jasonhckim/Logistic_Regression_Project)

<img src="images/bank image.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project you will be provided with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in 92% accuracy using Logistic Regression and SMOTE .
(https://github.com/jasonhckim/Logistic_Regression_Project/blob/main/Step2_Logistic_Regression_Project.ipynb)

- in this project we are given real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
- The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

[TalkingData Project on Bagging and Boosting Ensemble Model:](https://github.com/jasonhckim/Bagging_boosting_project)

<img src="images/Mobile.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib,XGboost Classifier, BaggingClassifier

**Project Objective:** In this problem, we will use the features associated with clicks, such as IP address, operating system, device type, time of click etc. to predict the probability of a click being fraud.

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the Pepole who downloaded the app after watching the advertisement  with an accuracy of 90% .

- Used the XGboost Classifier algorithm to classify the Pepole who downloaded the app after watching the advertisement and identify the click fraud
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a BaggingClassifier model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

[Amazon Fine Food Analysis Using NLP](https://github.com/jasonhckim/NLP_Projects)

<img src="images/amazon.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, TfidVectorizer

**Project Objective:** Given a review, determine whether the review is positive or negative based on Amazon foods .

**Quantifiable result:** We could use the Score/Rating. A rating of 4 or 5 could be cosnidered a positive review. A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review of 3 is neutral and ignored. This is an approximate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positivity/negativity) 

[**AUC** Score of 92%](https://github.com/jasonhckim/NLP_Projects/blob/main/NLP_Project.ipynb) .
- Given a review, it is determined whether the review is positive or negative.
- Used NLP for this approach.
- A review of 1 or 2 could be considered negative. A review of 3 is nuetral and ignored.

[Diagnosis of breast cancer using a logistic classifier](https://github.com/jasonhckim/KNN_PROJECT)

<img src="images/breast-cancer.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Identification of the type of Breast Cancer for quicker diagnosis. This assists professionals in the medical field to take appropiate measures to accurately diagnose, treat and save lives. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**85.48%** accuracy using K-means algorithm](https://github.com/jasonhckim/KNN_PROJECT/blob/main/KNN_NB_PROJECT.ipynb).

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Identifying given picture is a Cat or a Dog](https://github.com/jasonhckim/CNN)

<img src="images/Dog-and-Cat.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:** Prediction of whether a given image is a Cat or a Dog using Convolutional Neural Networks which may be further implemented as a feature in a bigger project.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**80%** using **25** epochs](https://github.com/jasonhckim/CNN/blob/main/Convolutional_Neural_Network.ipynb).

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of given data
- Fitting the CNN to see if the provided image is dog or cat
